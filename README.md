## 🚀 About Me

I’m a curious and motivated learner transitioning into software development, with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and using technology to solve real-world problems. Over the past few years, I’ve been building a strong foundation in Python, full-stack development, and core math subjects like algebra, calculus, and statistics.

Recently, I developed a machine learning pipeline to forecast football match patterns, using tools like XGBoost, SHAP for explainability, and cloud deployment on Google Cloud Platform. This project helped me realize how much I enjoy learning by doing—and how meaningful it is to create something useful from scratch.

I’m currently diving deeper into AI, including supervised learning, model evaluation, and explainability techniques. What excites me most is building AI-powered tools that help people make better decisions—especially in areas like health, finance, and education.


🧠 I’m particularly passionate about:
- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Problem-solving with code**
- **Tech for social good**

As I transition into software development, I'm focused on sharpening my skills in:
- ✅ Python & Java fundamentals
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming & Design
- ✅ Data Structures & Algorithms
- ✅ Git & Version Control
- ✅ Collaborative projects & Agile development
